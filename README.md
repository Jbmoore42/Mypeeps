APP Description
I decided to create an app that allows users to discuss Bible verses with each other. I have seen on my many platforms that it is so, it would be nice for two people to have a platform where you can discuss verses. This is a verse of the day that users can discuss, and there are sample verses that users can draw from and discuss. Users can also reply to other users' discussion posts. There are translations and places to find verses to talk about, and there is a text-to-speech feature if people need it. 
Initial Prompt and Cursor Response
Can you please change the app so you can post bible verses and people can discuss them?
This was the cursor's response: This modified version of the app now: Allows users to share Bible verses with their reference and personal thoughts, Displays verses in a card format, enables discussions through comments on each verse, Has a clean, modern design suitable for, Bible study discussions, To use the app: Click the + button to add a new verse, Fill in the verse reference, text, and your thoughts, View, verses in the main list, Add comments to discuss each verse.

Summary
Final App Description: This app is a Bibble discussion app that allows users to discuss verses from the bible, and people can comment on them. There is a verse of the day that people can discuss and comment on. This app gives users a platform for people to discuss verses together, and the various features that I added help them discuss these verses with each other.
What I liked about Cursor: I feel that it was easy to create that app and add features once I got the hang of it. I feel that it is a great platform to create simple apps without knowing how to code. I also think that if you really know what you are doing, you can create amazing things
Challenges / Issues: I had major issues downloading firebase and implenting it and cloudinary into my app. I feel that the ai is not always the most helpful and that you have to refine the stuff it presents you with. I wish I knew more about coding and could fix the issues that I had with the app because there were times were I needed to ask for help because I could not fix it and nor could the bot.
Overall, I enjoyed this project because, although it was challenging, I am satisfied with the results and I was able to learn more about coding. I also learned how to navigate and learn how to use Terminal.
